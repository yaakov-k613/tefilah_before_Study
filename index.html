    <title>Tefilah Before Studying Technology</title>
</head>
<body>
    Master of the Universe,
You have granted each soul a mission — to make this world a dwelling place for You.
As I begin my studies, let every line of code and every thought of design
become a vessel for Your light, revealing Elokus even within technology.

Grant me clarity of mind and purity of intention,
that my knowledge serve not pride, but purpose —
to bring closer the Geulah through spreading wisdom, connection, and truth.

Bless me with success in understanding, diligence in effort, and joy in creation.
Let my learning strengthen the sparks of holiness within the world of logic and machines,
so that I may transform this knowledge into tools of kindness, unity, and Kedushah.

May this study be part of preparing the world
for the revelation of Moshiach Tzidkeinu —
speedily, in our days.
    

<p>Master of the Universe,
<br>
<br>
You are the One who gives wisdom to the wise and understanding to those who seek knowledge.
Illuminate my mind in the study of knowledge and the wisdom of creation,
so that I may use my understanding to bring honor to Your holy Name in the world.</p>

<p>Grant me focus, a discerning heart, and a steady hand.
Help me grasp the structure and logic of what I learn,
to design with wisdom and to build with integrity.</p>

<p>May my studies be for the sake of Heaven —
to perfect the world and to provide for my family with dignity.
Let the work of my hands find favor before You,
for all comes from You, and from Your hand it is given.</p>

<p>You graciously endow man with knowledge, and teach understanding to humanity —
grant me, from You, wisdom, understanding, and insight.”</p>
