<p style="width: 500px;">Master of the Universe,
<br>
<br>
You are the One who gives wisdom to the wise and understanding to those who seek knowledge.
Illuminate my mind in the study of knowledge and the wisdom of creation,
so that I may use my understanding to bring honor to Your holy Name in the world.</p>

<p>Grant me focus, a discerning heart, and a steady hand.
Help me grasp the structure and logic of what I learn,
to design with wisdom and to build with integrity.</p>

<p>May my studies be for the sake of Heaven —
to perfect the world and to provide for my family with dignity.
Let the work of my hands find favor before You,
for all comes from You, and from Your hand it is given.</p>

<p>You graciously endow man with knowledge, and teach understanding to humanity —
grant me, from You, wisdom, understanding, and insight.”</p>
